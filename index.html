    <p><h1>Are Self-Driving Cars really safe for the American market?</h1></p>
	<p><h2>No Flight Unless its Right!</h2></p>
    <p>
		In a nation where so many people love to drive, it may take a long time for these people to put their lives into the hands of a computer. Whether we like it or not, this movement  is happening and there is a large chance it could make road travel even more dangerous if left unchecked. Self Driving cars are not yet ready for the American market and a study from the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institution shows that Self-Driving cars have a five times higher crash rate than regular cars.

Self-Driving cars use a series of cameras and sensors to drive and “see” where it is going. Faults with these cameras include glare from the sun. When the sun's light bounces off a white object such as another car or snow, it will create glare on the cameras which can cause crashes because they won't be able to see. A man in Florida was killed in a Tesla because the cameras could not pick up a white eighteen-wheeler in front of it.</p>

<p>Another problem is the fact that a self-driving car will never have the decision making skills of a person and will not be able to make good judgment calls when put into a situation of ethics that has no way out of it. A situation like this could be hitting an elderly person or hitting a child that is walking across the street. A third problem with self-driving cars is how when you are in the city and there are pedestrians you need to make gestures to people and other vehicles on when to go and and when to ask to get through. However, a self-driving car may be doing its own thing so that may become a problem for other drivers in a crowded city. Programmers have programmed the vehicles to do certain things in different types of situations so the programmer may have pre-decided people's deaths and injuries in the future.

    <p>A couple of solutions for the problems of self-driving cars would be to get many car manufacturers and companies together to do extensive testing on the same base of automated driving technology. The most important goal of any auto manufacturer should be the safety of their customers so if the basic technology is the same and the individual companies tweak little things in the software by themselves this system could be even better.

	Another solution for these problems would be to wait until majority of the cars on the road have this self-driving technology so that the cars can collaborate with each other and drastically reduce crashes. Another solution could be to teach the computer different types of obstacles and objects so that when the cars are ready, they know what to do in different situations depending on what it is and can differentiate different types of objects such as a motorcycle rider who is wearing a helmet versus one who is not wearing one.</p>

Self-Driving cars are unsafe for the American market because there are many technical flaws, the tech is fairly new and not properly tested, and many people cannot afford a vehicle that has this amount of sophisticated technology so it goes against the final goal of a safer road vehicle and reducing crashes if people cannot get one for a fair price. It is up to the auto manufactures to stop worrying about getting the cars out to the public first and to solve these problems. </p>

Cadillac introduced their self-driving car in 2015, the CT6, and is already discontinuing it because it didn't work very well. Audi does not sell their self-driving car, the A8, in America because of problems with the driving terrain. The self-driving tech in the Audi only works at speed under 37 miles an hour so it is useless at highway speeds where it would be the best to use. Tesla has taken the fully autonomous driving feature out of their cars after it was added in 2016 because it is nowhere near ready to be released and it took them two years to realize it. This information shows that self-driving tech is definitely not ready for the road.</p>
